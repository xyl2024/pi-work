/**
 * IndexedDB-backed storage for Excalidraw image files (paste / drop payloads).
 *
 * Excalidraw's `onChange(elements, appState, files)` emits `files` keyed by
 * `fileId`; only the `fileId` is embedded in image elements (with
 * `status: "pending"`). The actual dataURL lives here so it survives reload.
 *
 * Mirrors `lib/db.ts`'s boundary: only this module knows about the storage
 * backend. Singleton store cached on `globalThis` so Next.js dev-mode HMR
 * doesn't re-open the database on every code change.
 *
 * Browser-only. Callers must be behind `dynamic({ ssr: false })` or
 * otherwise guarantee `indexedDB` is defined (see `components/CanvasPanel.tsx`).
 *
 * # Garbage collection
 *
 * Mirrors `excalidraw-app/data/LocalData.ts` `LocalFileManager.clearObsoleteFiles`:
 * an orphan file (no element references it) is reaped once it has been
 * untouched for 24h. "Touched" means a read that updated `lastRetrieved`,
 * so frequently-used files stay alive while delete-and-leave-it images
 * eventually free their quota.
 *
 * The sweep is opt-in — `deleteOrphanFiles(referencedIds)` — and is
 * triggered from the canvas panel on initial mount.
