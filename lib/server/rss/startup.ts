 * Process-startup hook for the RSS refresh loop.

 * Mirrors `lib/scheduler/startup.ts` and `lib/wechat/startup.ts`: called from
 * `instrumentation.ts` so the loop boots as soon as the server is ready,
 * regardless of whether any page has been requested. Idempotent — safe to
 * call multiple times (which can happen across HMR reloads in dev mode).
