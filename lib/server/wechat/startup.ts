/**
 * Process-startup hook for the WeChat channel.
 *
 * The monitor is normally lazy-started by the /api/weixin/contacts endpoint
 * when the user opens the WeChat panel. That fails one important case:
 * pi-work boots up with an existing account.json on disk, and the user
 * never opens the panel — incoming WeChat messages would sit in the
 * upstream queue unconsumed.
 *
 * `bootstrap()` is invoked from instrumentation.ts so it runs once per
 * server-process boot. It also schedules a periodic re-check so a future
 * login from another tab/process is picked up without a server restart.
 *
 * When multiple pi-work processes run on the same machine (e.g. `next
 * start` on port 14514 + `next dev` on port 30141), only the lock holder
 * from `monitor-lock.ts` actually runs the monitor — the others stay
 * silent so the inbound poller is never duplicated.
