Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## 5. Never Destroy User Data

**Treat any file in a user data directory as irreplaceable until proven otherwise.**

A single careless command can wipe data that has no backup, is not in git, and cannot be recovered. This is not a theoretical risk — it has happened here.

### The hard rules

- **NEVER** run overwrite commands (`cat > file`, `echo > file`, `> file`, `tee file`, `sed -i`, `python3 -c "open(p,'w').write(...)"`) on any file in `~/.pi-work/`, `~/.pi/`, `~/.config/...`, or any other user data directory. These truncate the file before the new content is written; if the new content is malformed, the original is gone with no undo.
- **NEVER** use shell heredoc (`<< EOF ... EOF`) to "create a small test file" at a path that overlaps with a real file. Heredoc + `>` overwrites silently.
- **For tests that need to touch user data**: copy the file to `/tmp/` first, work on the copy, and never write back to the original path. If a test must hit the real file, drive it through the app's own API (POST/PATCH/DELETE) — those code paths are tested and validated.
- **For JSON modification**: use `jq` (in-place with `jq ... file.json > tmp && mv tmp file.json`) or run a Node script. Do not use raw shell redirection.
- **Before any write to user data**: take a backup with `cp file file.bak.$(date +%s)` first. If something goes wrong, restore the backup.

### Why this is so dangerous in this project specifically

- The user todo list is stored in `~/.pi-work/todos.db` (SQLite via `better-sqlite3`). The legacy `todos.json` was renamed to `todos.json.migrated.<ts>` on first DB read — it is **not** deleted and can be inspected with `cat`. To roll back: run `npx tsx scripts/todos-restore.ts` (writes a fresh `todos.json` from the DB; if `--out` already exists it is renamed to `<out>.restored.<ts>` first, matching the rename-not-delete migration pattern).
- The `cat > ~/.pi-work/todos.db` (or `todos.json`) idiom is the kind of thing that looks safe in a one-liner test script but truncates the file immediately. If the heredoc body is wrong, the file is `0 bytes` and unrecoverable.
- Other irreplaceable user data in this project: `~/.pi-work/todo_images/`, `~/.pi-work/workspace/`, `~/.pi-work/config.yaml`, `~/.pi-work/scheduler.db`, `~/.pi-work/favorites.json`, `~/.pi-work/agent-todo/`, `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`, `~/.pi/agent/models.json`, `~/.pi-work/pinned.json`, `~/.pi-work/todo-tools.json`.
- The agent todo state lives in `~/.pi-work/agent-todo/<sessionId>.jsonl` (append-only snapshots). The current state is the last parsed line; truncating the file wipes it instantly with no DB backup.

### If a write goes wrong

1. **Stop.** Do not run more commands. Every subsequent write makes recovery harder.
2. Check if the user's browser app is still open and the React state still has the data. If so, do **not** let them refresh. Have them copy the state out via DevTools (`copy(JSON.stringify(window))` in Console, or React DevTools → TodoProvider state) before anything else.
3. Look for backups in `/tmp/`, `~/.*.bak`, `~/.local/share/Trash/`, the project's `.cache/`, or the running server's memory (`/proc/<pid>/maps` → `heap` region).
4. Only after exhausting recovery options, tell the user what was lost and what remains.

**The cost of "I'll just write a small test file to that path" can be the user's entire data. Don't take that bet.**

## 6. Don't Touch the Production Environment Without Permission

**Production build/restart is a user-initiated decision — never an autonomous side effect.**

The user's terminal may already be running `run_pi_web.sh`, a systemd user unit, or some other long-lived process serving traffic. A surprise rebuild or restart is disruptive, slow, and often irreversible mid-session. Even if the server "looks down," do not start it back up on your own.

### The hard rules

- **NEVER** run `npm run build` on the user's behalf. The dev loop is `npm run dev`; production builds are deliberate (`run_pi_web.sh` consumes a fresh bundle, and `next build` also pollutes `.next/` in a way that breaks `npm run dev`).
- **NEVER** kill, restart, start, or otherwise touch the production server process — `run_pi_web.sh`, systemd user units (`systemctl --user ...`), or anything else bound to a shared port. This includes `pkill` / `kill` / `killall` against a server PID, even if it "looks stuck."
- **NEVER** run `scripts/deploy-systemd-user.sh`, launch the Electron shell on the user's behalf, or publish a build to a shared location.
- **NEVER** treat "the prod server is responding on port X" as a green light to take a side action. Read-only probing is fine; anything that mutates the running stack is not.

If a task seems to call for one of these — even a "small" rebuild that "feels safe" — stop, name what you want to run and why, and wait for an explicit OK. The user is the only one who knows whether now is the moment to interrupt the running service.

# Pi Work

Web UI for the pi coding agent. The product is called "Pi Work" (renamed from "Pi Agent Web"). The package is `@xyl2024/pi-work`.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm run dev   # port 30141
```

Typecheck: `node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit`
Lint (targeted — fast, ~4s): `node_modules/.bin/eslint <files-you-changed>`
Lint (full — use before commit / in CI): `npm run lint` (= `eslint .`)

`tsc --noEmit` is mandatory after every change. Targeted `eslint <files>` is
fast enough to run alongside it; full `npm run lint` lints the whole 1100+-file
tree and surfaces a long tail of pre-existing warnings, so skip it locally
unless you want to gate on it. The `next lint` subcommand was removed in Next 16.
**Never run `next build` during dev** — pollutes `.next/` and breaks `npm run dev`.

## npm install gotchas

### `NODE_ENV=production` silently skips devDependencies

Any shell spawned from the running production server (check
`echo $NODE_ENV`; `npm_lifecycle_script=next start ...` in the env is a
smoking gun) has `NODE_ENV=production`, which makes `npm install` default to
`--omit=dev`. Result: devDependencies (`typescript`, `@types/*`, …) are never
installed, and npm reports **"up to date"** while installing nothing.

Symptoms:
- `node_modules/.bin/tsc` doesn't exist, or `tsc --noEmit` floods with
  `TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module 'js-yaml'/'ws'/...`
  for packages that ARE in package.json/package-lock.json.
- `npm install <devDep>` says "up to date" but the folder never appears.

Fix: `npm install --include=dev` (or `unset NODE_ENV` first).

### npm registry CDN flakes on some tarballs

`registry.npmjs.org` metadata responds fine but certain tarballs (e.g.
`typescript-5.9.3.tgz`) hang on direct connection, while other packages
download fine — the official CDN is unreliable from this network. If an
install hangs or fails on tarball fetch, retry with the mirror, which is a
command-line flag and does NOT touch `.npmrc`:

```bash
npm install --registry=https://registry.npmmirror.com
```

### npm believes a partial node_modules is complete

If `node_modules` is missing packages but npm keeps saying "up to date", the
hidden `node_modules/.package-lock.json` (npm's internal install state) is
out of sync. Delete it to force a real reconciliation:

```bash
rm -f node_modules/.package-lock.json
npm install --include=dev --registry=https://registry.npmmirror.com
```

The two gotchas above compound: the 2026-08 node_modules breakage was exactly
this — production-inherited env + flaky official CDN — and the combo command
above fixed it (added 278 packages).

## Production startup

For long-running local use, do not use `npm run dev`. After source changes,
build the production bundle:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the production server with:

```bash
/home/alone/.xyl_scripts/run_pi_web.sh
```

## Electron shell (optional desktop wrapper)

`electron-shell/` ships a small Electron app that embeds the running Pi Work
in an `<iframe>` with a custom macOS-style traffic-light titlebar. It expects
the server on `PI_PORT` (default `14514`) and connects to `http://localhost:<port>`.

- The iframe must declare `allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write"` or the
  Chromium Permissions-Policy will silently block every
  `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` call inside Pi Work.
- DevTools toggle: F12 / Ctrl+Shift+I (handled in `titlebar.js`).
- Tray icon + global shortcut + `--hidden` flag are part of the Phase 1 scope
  in `main.js`; see that file for current behavior.

```

**Session browsing** (read-only): reads `.jsonl` files directly via `lib/session-reader.ts` — no AgentSession created.
**Sending a message**: `startRpcSession()` in `lib/rpc-manager.ts` creates an AgentSession in-process.

### Process startup

`instrumentation.ts` runs once per server boot. It lazily imports the WeChat
monitor bootstrap, the scheduler loop bootstrap, and the RSS poll-loop
bootstrap, so a logged-in WeChat account, any enabled cron tasks, and any
configured RSS feeds start being serviced as soon as the server is up — no
need to load any page first.

### Right-panel architecture

The right side of `AppShell` hosts a stack of tool panels, each backed by a
module-scoped store using `useSyncExternalStore`:

- `sessionUiStore` — branch leaf (`branchTree`/`ActiveLeafId`), `systemPrompt`, `sessionStats`, `contextUsage`. Owned by `useAgentSession`, read by `AppShell`. Imperative session controls (model/thinking/tools/compact) are bridged to `CommandPalette` ⌘K via the separate `useAgentControls()` hook, **not** part of this store's snapshot.
- `toolCallStatsStore` — per-turn tool call statistics, owned by `useAgentSession`, read by the vertical button + `ToolCallStatsPanel`.

The store pattern eliminates the previous "5 separate `onXxxChange` props +
matching `useState` in AppShell" dance and makes state survive `ChatWindow`
remounts (no top-bar flash on session switches).

### Custom command palette

`lib/commands.tsx` defines a typed command registry (each command has an SVG
icon, keybinding, predicate, and run function). `CommandPalette` (⌘K,
Raycast-style) is wired into `AppShell` and reads + dispatches agent
controls registered by the active `ChatWindow` via `setAgentControls()`. New
agent-facing actions belong here rather than as ad-hoc top-bar buttons.

### Scheduler

Cron-based task runner in `lib/scheduler/`. The loop (self-rescheduling
`setTimeout`, no `setInterval` drift) is started by `lib/scheduler/startup.ts`
from `instrumentation.ts`. Every CRUD on `/api/scheduled-tasks` calls
`reschedule()` so the loop picks up changes immediately. Each run cold-starts
a fresh pi session (the scheduler never shares a wrapper with a user's open
session) and records `{ running, success, error, timeout }` outcomes to
`scheduled_task_runs`.

### Permission dialog

`PermissionProvider` (in `hooks/usePendingPermissions.tsx`) listens for
inbound permission requests from the SSE stream and renders a portal'd
`PermissionDialog` with **Esc → deny**, **Enter → allow once**, and
backdrop-click → deny as the safe defaults. Decisions are POSTed back to the
session; queue is mirrored in a `useRef` so async handlers always see the
latest list when removing by `toolCallId`.

### Custom agent tools

`lib/rpc-manager.ts` registers these as `customTools` on `createAgentSession`:

- `user_todos_list` / `user_todo_description` — read-only todo queries against `~/.pi-work/todos.db` (`lib/todo-tools.ts`, gated by `~/.pi-work/todo-tools.json`). The first returns a lightweight summary filterable by `status` / `tags` / `create_time_window` / `due_time_window`; the second fetches full description + image URLs by id. Set `PI_WORK_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to control the image origin in the second tool's output.
- `show_media` — inline-render one or more **multimedia** files (image / video / audio) below the tool call in chat (`lib/show-file-tool.ts` + `lib/show-file-tool-types.ts`). Path validation reuses `lib/file-access.ts` (same allowed roots as `/api/files`). The tool rejects PDF / Markdown / HTML / plain text / binary paths — use the right-hand FileViewer for those. The legacy alias `show_file` is still recognised by the derive layer (Session Library) and config (`~/.pi-work/config.yaml`) for backward compatibility.
- `agent_todo` — single-tool action-dispatched (`create | update | list | get | delete | clear`); persisted per-session to `~/.pi-work/agent-todo/<sessionId>.jsonl` as append-only snapshots (`lib/agent-todo-store.ts`). Full design in `docs/agent-todo/`.

Server-only files (`*-tool.ts`, `*-store.ts` under `lib/`) import `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, which transitively pulls in `child_process` and other Node modules. **Client code must import types/constants from the matching `-types.ts` file instead** — see the `IMPORTANT` comment at the top of each tool file.

## Key Design Decisions & Traps

### AgentSession lifecycle (`lib/rpc-manager.ts`)
- One `AgentSessionWrapper` per session id, keyed in `globalThis.__piSessions`
- `globalThis` survives Next.js hot-reload; plain module-level Map does not
- Idle timeout: 10 minutes. Concurrent `startRpcSession()` calls share a single start Promise (`globalThis.__piStartLocks`)
- `customTools` registered here: `buildTodoTools(...)`, `buildShowFileTool()` (registers the `show_media` tool), `buildAgentTodoTool()` — the trio that gives pi-work sessions their distinctive toolset

### In-session branching only
Branches live inside a single `.jsonl` file. The `Edit from here` button on any user message calls `navigate_tree` against the current session; the resulting entries share a `parentId` and the BranchNavigator lets the user switch between them. Switching between leaves calls `/api/sessions/[id]/context?leafId=`.

### Session files can be fully rewritten
`parentSession` in the header is **display metadata only** — has zero effect on chat content. Safe to `writeFileSync` the entire file (pi does this itself during migrations). Used when cascade-reparenting children on delete.

### ToolCall field normalization
Pi stores toolCall blocks as `{type:"toolCall", id, name, arguments}` but `ToolCallContent` uses `{toolCallId, toolName, input}`. `normalizeToolCalls()` in `lib/normalize.ts` handles this — called when loading messages from session files (`session-reader.ts`) and when processing streaming events in `useAgentSession`.

### New session tool preset
Tool names are passed at session creation (`POST /api/agent/new` → `toolNames[]`). `ToolPanel` exports only two presets — `"none"` (empty array) and `"full"` (every tool pi registers at runtime); `PRESET_NONE` is the single named export. When tools are fully disabled (`toolNames = []`), `rpc-manager.ts` clears `agent.state.systemPrompt` directly (the only way to truly blank it — `buildSystemPrompt` always emits non-empty).

### Model defaults for new sessions
`GET /api/models` returns `defaultModel` read from `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`, plus per-model `thinkingLevels` and `thinkingLevelMaps`. `useAgentSession` pre-selects `defaultModel` on mount for new sessions.

### SSE reconnect on page refresh mid-stream
On `useAgentSession` mount, `GET /api/sessions/[id]?includeState` is called. If `agentState.state.isStreaming === true`, SSE is reconnected automatically. `thinkingLevel`, `isCompacting`, and `contextUsage` are also synced from this response.

### Compaction SSE events
Newer pi emits `compaction_start` / `compaction_end`; older versions emitted `auto_compaction_start` / `auto_compaction_end`. `handleAgentEvent` accepts both sets to keep `isCompacting` in sync. Manual compact is a blocking POST — the button stays disabled until the response returns.

### Module-scoped stores
`sessionUiStore` and `toolCallStatsStore` follow the same pattern: one typed state object, `useSyncExternalStore` subscription, content-equality guarded patcher (`lib/shallowEqual.ts`). `sessionUiStore` exposes both a state snapshot and a separate `useAgentControls()` hook — imperative controls are bridged via the hook, not the snapshot, so identity-based re-render loops are avoided. When adding a new cross-cutting UI state, follow this pattern — it survives `ChatWindow` remounts and eliminates prop-drilling.

### Description sanitization is centralized
`lib/description-sanitize.ts` is the single source of truth for the DOMPurify config used by every code path that touches a todo description: storage normalization, editor save/mount, read-only view render, legacy markdown migration, and zip export (which uses `allowStyle: false`). Adding a new tag/attribute to descriptions requires touching this one file. The `style` widening is gated by an idempotent `uponSanitizeAttribute` hook that rewrites every style value to only `color: #rrggbb` — opening `style` without that hook would be a CSS-injection vector.

### Permission defaults are safe
`PermissionDialog` (Esc → deny, Enter → allow once, backdrop-click → deny) deliberately biases toward deny because "allow similar for this session" is a mouse-only action — keyboard users can never accidentally over-grant.

### pi extensions never see a UI
`startRpcSession` does not call `bindExtensions`, so `ctx.hasUI` is `false` in every pi-work session. Extensions that gate on `hasUI` (e.g. `extensions/clawd-on-desk/`) need their vendored `index.ts` to override `shouldReport` to `() => true` — see the `pi-work-never-binds-extension-ui` memory for the full pattern.

### Translate panel does not touch disk
`/api/translate` builds a custom `ResourceLoader` that returns empty arrays for everything plus `SessionManager.inMemory()` + `SettingsManager.inMemory()` + `noTools: "all"`. This guarantees the request never reads `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`, never fires any extension hook, and never writes a `.jsonl` file — see the comment at the top of `app/api/translate/route.ts`.

## Pi Session File Format

Location: `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`

```jsonl
{"type":"session","version":3,"id":"<uuid>","timestamp":"...","cwd":"/path","parentSession":"/abs/path/to/parent.jsonl"}
{"type":"model_change","id":"<8hex>","parentId":null,"provider":"zenmux","modelId":"claude-sonnet-4-6","timestamp":"..."}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"user","content":"..."}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[...],...}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"toolResult","toolCallId":"...","content":[...]}}
{"type":"compaction","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","summary":"...","firstKeptEntryId":"<8hex>","tokensBefore":N}
{"type":"session_info","id":"...","parentId":"...","name":"user-defined name"}
```

`entryIds[]` in `SessionContext` is a parallel array to `messages[]` — maps each displayed message back to its `.jsonl` entry id, used for navigate_tree calls.

## Agent Todo JSONL Format

Location: `~/.pi-work/agent-todo/<sessionId>.jsonl`

```jsonl
{"ts":<ms>,"action":"create","stateAfter":{"tasks":[...],"nextId":2}}
{"ts":<ms>,"action":"update","stateAfter":{...}}
```

Append-only snapshots — current state is the last parsed line's `stateAfter`. O(1) tail read. `agent-todo-store.ts` always `fsync`s before returning the tool result, and the frontend picks up new state via 1.5s HTTP polling on `/api/agent/[id]/agent-todo` (`useAgentTodo.ts`), not via SSE. Tombstoned tasks are kept (not deleted) so `blockedBy` references and audit history still resolve.

---

## CSS Variables (`app/globals.css`)

Theme presets (`.theme-default`, `.theme-midnight`, `.theme-synthwave`, `.theme-forest`, …) set these vars; pick from `useTheme`.

```
--bg --bg-panel --bg-hover --bg-selected --bg-subtle --border
--text --text-muted --text-dim
--accent --accent-hover --user-bg --assistant-bg --tool-bg
--font-sans --font-mono
```

The LXGW WenKai font (CJK) was previously vendored but has been removed; CJK characters now fall through `--font-sans` to the system font stack (`PingFang SC`, `Microsoft YaHei`, etc.). Noto Sans Mono is loaded via `next/font/google` as `--font-noto-mono`.

---

## i18n for Frontend Text

**All user-visible strings in new components must go through i18n — never hardcode display text.**

When adding or modifying frontend components:
- Extract every user-facing string (labels, placeholders, tooltips, aria-labels, status messages, error text) into the i18n dictionary at `hooks/useI18n.tsx`.
- Use the project's existing i18n mechanism (`t('key')` from `useI18n()`) — don't invent a new pattern.
- Keys are the English source string itself; add the Chinese translation in the `ZH_TRANSLATIONS` map. Look at nearby keys before creating new ones.

---

## Toast Notifications for New Frontend Interactions

**Any new user-initiated frontend action that can fail or completes silently needs a toast — see `components/Toast.tsx` for the global system.**

When adding or modifying frontend interactions, decide whether a toast is needed:

- **Add a toast** for: server-bound actions (save, delete, rename, send, copy, fetch, OAuth login, install, export, scheduler run, HTTP send/cancel) and for successes of operations that otherwise complete silently.
- **Skip a toast** for: actions whose feedback is purely local UI state (toggles, expand/collapse, theme switch, sound on/off) and for forms where the error must stay inline next to the field (rename conflicts, validation messages, modal-internal footer text).

Conventions:
- Call `useToast()` from `./Toast` (or `@/components/Toast`) and invoke `toast.show({ kind, message })` — don't invent a parallel notification mechanism.
- Prefer the server-provided error string and fall back to a generic i18n key: `e instanceof Error && e.message ? e.message : t("Network error")`.
- Past-tense keys cover most successes (`t("Saved")`, `t("Renamed")`, `t("Copied")`, `t("Deleted")`); add new keys to `hooks/useI18n.tsx` only when none fits. The "Common-operation toasts" comment in `useI18n.tsx` is the canonical place to add them.
- Modal-internal feedback (the "Saved" button label, red footer text) should stay in addition to the toast — the toast is the cross-area confirmation that survives outside the modal.
- The 1-second dedupe in `Toast.tsx` handles repeated onerror events; don't add your own.
- `useConfirm()` from `./ConfirmDialog` is the matching modal for destructive confirms ("Delete this collection?", "Cancel this HTTP request?") — pair with a toast on success.

## Clipboard in the Electron Shell

When Pi Work is loaded inside the `electron-shell` `<iframe>`, every
`navigator.clipboard.writeText()` call requires the iframe to declare
`allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write"` (set in `electron-shell/titlebar.html`).
Without it, Chromium's Permissions-Policy silently blocks the call. The web
app has a `document.execCommand("copy")` fallback in `components/CodeBlock.tsx`'s
`copyText()` helper (also reached by `MermaidBlock.tsx`, `SvgBlock.tsx`,
`FileExplorer.tsx`) — but the iframe attribute is the canonical fix and the
fallback should not be relied on.
